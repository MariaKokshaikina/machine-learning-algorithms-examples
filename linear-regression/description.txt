Discussion:

In various states, population and drinking data was recorded.

There are 46 rows of data.The data includes:

I,the index;
A0, 1;
A1, the size of the urban population,
A2, the number of births to women between 45 to 49
(actually, the reciprocal of that value, times 100)
A3, the consumption of wine per capita,
A4, the consumption of hard liquor per capita,
B,the death rate from cirrhosis.

We seek a model of the form:

B = A0 * X0 + A1 * X1 + A2 * X2 + A3 * X3 + A4 * X4.
